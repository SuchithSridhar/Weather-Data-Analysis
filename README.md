# Weather-Data-Analysis
Analyzing weather data of Maharashtra's cities to see if the sea affects the weather.


The program has 2 ways to load the data of the cities we analyze into the program,
the default way loads them in from the notepad files. However, one can also 
use the get_data() function to load it in from the API.


The plot_type argument in the functions have to be one of these:
avgtemp
temperature
humidity
pressure
weather_description
wind_speed
wind_degree.
